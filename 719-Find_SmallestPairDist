# 719 - Find k-th smallest pari distance 
# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-th-smallest-pair-distance/description/
# This is a hard problem, as the inituition would be to solve it using brutal force, 
# but the it will pass the time limit. 
# so the more efficient solution would be to combine binary search and the sorting
